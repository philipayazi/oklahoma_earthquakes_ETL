Since 2014 there has been a dramatic spike increase in the number of earthquakes that occured in Oklahoma. Specifically, earthquakes of maginitude 3+ and greater have occured 579 time in 2014, 903 in 2015, 623 in 2016, and 304 in 2017. This ruise in seismic activity has the attention of independent scientists, citizens, policymakers, media an industry.

The purpose of this project is extract daily earthquake data from USGS. Transform that data to collect only earthquakes from Oklahoma and load it into MongoDB so that the data can be readily accessed for analysis.

The goal for this project is to passively collect earthquake data that can eventually be used to identify if an earthquake can be associated with a specific oil well.
